Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it functions as intended, meets specified requirements, and is free from defects.
It involves executing the software to identify bugs, validate performance, and verify its overall quality.
Testing can be done manually or using automated tools, and it includes various types such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
The goal is to detect issues early, improve the softwareâ€™s reliability, and deliver a high-quality product to users.
